# aoc-2021

This repository contains my [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions written in Haskell.

This is the first time I'm getting dirty with Haskell and so I'm very much in n00b territory. Please don't take these solutions as anything except something worth criticizing.
